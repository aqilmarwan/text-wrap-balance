This project is a live working showcase of `text-wrap: style` properties that demonstrates the practicality and distinct text layout variances associated with each property; including `auto`, `balance`, `stable` and `pretty`.

Important Note: The flexible illustration of the text layout doesn't work on Chrome & Edge.
